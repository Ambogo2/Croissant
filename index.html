    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, and crescent-shaped pastry of Austrian
      origin, though it is commonly associated with French cuisine. It is made
      from layered yeast-leavened dough, which is folded and rolled several
      times to create multiple layers of butter and dough.
